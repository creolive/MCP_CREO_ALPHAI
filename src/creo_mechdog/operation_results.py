"""Terminal operation result projection shared by native and job views (T02).

The native executor publishes one terminal record per requested operation with
a zero-based ``index``, an ``execution_status`` and an ``effect_status``. This
module keeps the persisted job result on the same contract: it only fills the
two status fields for records that predate the native change (legacy jobs and
synthetic fixtures) and never invents records or upgrades unknown outcomes.

Existing ``succeeded`` stays a report of the execution fact. It never implies
that the transaction committed; ``effect_status`` carries that meaning.
